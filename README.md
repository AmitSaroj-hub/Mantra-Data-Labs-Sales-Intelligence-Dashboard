##  Project Objective
This project showcases a dynamic sales performance dashboard built using Microsoft Excel for a national distributor. The goal was to transform three years of raw transactional data (2022–2024) into actionable insights across product categories, regions, and sales channels. The dashboard enables business stakeholders to monitor trends, evaluate brand growth, and assess promotional effectiveness.

##  Project Process

   - Loaded raw sales data into Power Query.
   - Derived four analytical columns:
     - `Year`, `Month`, `MonthName` from the `date` column.
     - `Revenue` by multiplying `price_unit` with `units_sold`.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - The dataset was mostly clean, requiring minimal preprocessing.

3. **PivotTable Creation**
   - Built PivotTables to analyze revenue, units sold by Year, Channel, Month, Category, Pack Type, and Promotion Flag.

4. **Dashboard Design**
   - Inserted appropriate charts (line, bar, pie) and slicers.
   - Customized layout and formatting for clarity and professionalism.
   - Created a dynamic, interactive dashboard that updates with new data.
